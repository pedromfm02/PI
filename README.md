# Project in Informatics
The objective of this course, was to develop the final team project of the degree, in near real-world situations.
The project that i ended up developing with my colegues, was a chat bot that leveraged both Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to monitor and index all relevant data sources pertaining to our department activities.
The project was called DetiBot.
